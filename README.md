# Template CV

Your CV is the first representation employers will look at when they're considering you for a role.

It’s the key which opens up the door for you to the opportunity you’re after.

If this key is broken, you’ll get locked out and get rejections.

AND there’s no number of doors you can try that will make this broken key work!

So instead of looking for company connections & MORE job opportunities, maybe it's worth thinking about the quality of your CV.

There are hundreds of ways you can find new connections & get access to thousands of opportunities.

But if somehow you still struggle to find a job or an employer that will provide you with visa sponsorship, it's likely not because of a numbers problem, it’s a quality problem.

The quality of your Candidate Presence, (CV, LinkedIn profile, etc..) and the way you are presenting yourself to these companies.

That’s what’s not working out for you.

The main three factors to keep in mind when building you Candidate Presence are: 

- Be compatible with the UK job market & formatted as such.
- Be targeting a niche skill or a high demand job in the UK.
- Show your relevant experience as well as highlight the role you are applying to!

Having these is your only chance in being able to stand out among some thousands of applicants for each role.

Below is a Free CV template which I included to help you get an idea of what structure, grammar & tone to use to make your CV stand out.
